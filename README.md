# Storybook UI Testing Handbook

This repository was created as part of my Front-End internship at Foothill Technology Solutions. It follows the [UI Testing Handbook](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/ui-testing-handbook/) tutorial provided by Storybook. The aim was to learn Storybook, a tool for developing UI components in isolation for React, Vue, and Angular.

## Overview

This repository contains the code and configurations resulting from following each chapter of the Storybook UI Testing Handbook tutorial. The tutorial covers various aspects of UI testing with Storybook, including setting up Storybook, writing stories, testing with Jest, and integrating with other tools.

## Demo
